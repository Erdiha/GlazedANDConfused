This produces a light crisp exterior with a soft fluffy inside that wont leave your hands greasy. Our ingredients and donut batter are Certified Kosher* to meet OU-D standards.

      "When Danny first saw a donut machine in sunny California on his honeymoon back in 2014 he knew it would be a huge success in New York City.  The idea was simple...bring donut joy to the streets of NYC. So Danny and Larry founded Glazed & Confused in April 2015. With their signature creations, comprised of delectable glazes and toppings, they have gone from streets of the five boroughs, to wedding halls in the New Jersey suburbs, to Long Island, the Hamptons, Connecticut, even Boston. Now they have brought their donuts all the way back to the West Coast!",

Danny didn\u2019t know that five years later, he would bring his mobile food business to California where it all began. After successfully building and operating 3 food trucks in the tri-state area, Danny expanded to LA/Orange county in 2020. But donut worry NJ/NY Glazed fans--Larry can still be found running the trucks on the East Coast!",
