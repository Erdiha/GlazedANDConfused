      'Our loyal fans know our donuts to be light and airy. This is because we use no artificial base ingredients and our donut batter is trans-fat free. The unique flavor comes from a blend of spices including nutmeg and turmeric. We fry all our donuts in vegetable oil at a very hot 375 degrees. This produces a light crisp exterior with a soft fluffy inside that wont leave your hands greasy. Our ingredients and donut batter are Certified Kosher* to meet OU-D standards. Gluten Free donuts and a Nut Free environment are also available for private events.',
